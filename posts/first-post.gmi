# First Post
2021-07-17 (Last update: 2021-08-10) :: Pukima

NOTE: This Site does not use Hugo or a theme cuz it is the gemini mirror. The Website I am talking about is:
=> https://pukima.site pukima.site

This is my new Blog on my new Website. To be honest I have no idea what I am going to write here. 
Probably mostly about tech and neat stuff I discover. For example 
=> https://gohugo.io Hugo
which I use for this Website.
Also theese post are just Markdown which is pretty neat. Hugo is pretty simple so you should try it out if you wanna create a fast website in minutes.
Also there are great Themes for Hugo for example 
=> https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal terminal 
which this sites uses.
